Install instructions for quadromania

This program currently is not installable at all.
Just compile and run it from its directory.

$ tar xvzf quadromania.tar.gz
$ cd quadromania/

Edit the Makefile for your target platform. You may need to tweak it, especially the CC= directive. 
You'll need SDL, SDL_image including development headers to properly compile
quadromania.

$ make
$ ./quadromania

Run with switch -f for fullscreen mode.

Make sure to have the data/ subdirectory below your working directory.
Perhaps some day i'll write a proper installable version.

If you try to build for a not supported target platform, you should create a patch for sysconfig.h
and a Makefile tailored for the new port.

Have fun!
