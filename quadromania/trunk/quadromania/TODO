TODO list for quadromania
	
	* save and restore volume setting from disk
	* add keyboard/joystick controlled extra cursors for platforms without touchscreen like the Dingoo A320	
	* add highscore management for all levels and game settings
	* add more ports (old GP2X, Atari, Mac)
	* add splash screen
	* fix: ESC from highscore list should go to main menu and not quit the game
