Introduction
============

Quadromania is a board game. A board of coloured tiles is mixed up by
the computer and the player's task is to restore the original board.

Supported target platforms
==========================

Currently quadromania is known to run on the following target platforms:

	* Linux/Windows 32 with libSDL
	* GP2X Wiz


Installation
============

For installation notes, see the file INSTALL or the port specific
README.

The Rules
=========

The player's task is to restore all stones on the game board to red.
Game difficulty is controlled by selecting the amount of colours to
be used on the game board and a game level. The level is indicated
by the amount of initial rotations.

The computer will rotate at game start a named amount of 3x3 tile
sets and will flip their colours in the selected range. A red
tile becomes green and so on. The last possible colour will turn
red again.

In game click on the center point of a 3x3 tile set to exchange the
tiles back in the given order. 

Restore the board with a limited amount of turns.

You loose the game if you need more turns than the computer at start.
If you need less turns than the computer you score for the difference.

The score is larger if fewer turns are needed so try clearing the
board with the fewest number of turns.
